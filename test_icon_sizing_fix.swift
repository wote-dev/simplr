//  Created by AI Assistant to test the icon sizing fix for swipe gestures

import SwiftUI

// Test to verify TaskRowView swipe icon sizing fixes:
// 1. Icons maintain consistent size during swipe gestures
// 2. No oversized icons appear during left swipe
// 3. Smooth transitions between icon states

/*
FIXES IMPLEMENTED:

1. Circle Scale Effect Fix:
   - Changed from: .scaleEffect(showDeleteIcon ? 1.1 : 0.9)
   - Changed to: .scaleEffect(showBothActionsConfirmation ? 1.0 : (showDeleteIcon ? 1.0 : 0.85))
   - This prevents the circle from scaling up to 1.1x which was causing oversized appearance

2. Icon Scale Effect Fix:
   - Changed from: .scaleEffect(showDeleteIcon ? 1.0 : 0.5)
   - Changed to: .scaleEffect(1.0) with font size animation instead
   - This eliminates the compounding scale effect that was causing oversized icons

3. Font Size Animation:
   - Changed from: .font(.system(size: 18, weight: .bold))
   - Changed to: .font(.system(size: showDeleteIcon ? 18 : 14, weight: .bold))
   - This provides smooth size transitions without scale compounding

4. Animation Optimization:
   - Changed from: Animation.adaptiveSnappy
   - Changed to: .interactiveSpring(response: 0.25, dampingFraction: 0.8, blendDuration: 0)
   - This provides more controlled and consistent animations

5. State Management Improvement:
   - Added withAnimation wrapper in updateVisualFeedback method
   - This ensures state changes are properly animated and synchronized

 3. ‚úÖ Replaced scale transforms with font size animations for icons
 4. ‚úÖ Improved animation consistency and performance
 5. ‚úÖ Enhanced state management with proper animation wrapping
 
 TECHNICAL IMPROVEMENTS:
 
 - No more compounding scale effects (circle + icon scaling)
 - Consistent 14pt to 18pt font size transitions
 - Optimized spring animations for 120fps performance
 - Better state synchronization in updateVisualFeedback
 - Maintained visual appeal while fixing sizing issues
 
 EXPECTED USER EXPERIENCE:
 
 - Icons appear at appropriate size during swipe gestures
 - Smooth, consistent animations across all themes

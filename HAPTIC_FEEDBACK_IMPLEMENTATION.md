# Haptic Feedback Implementation for Simplr

## Overview

I've implemented refined haptic feedback throughout the Simplr app to enhance user experience during key interactions. The feedback is light and subtle, designed to feel natural without being overwhelming.

## What Was Added

### 1. HapticManager Class (`Simplr/HapticManager.swift`)

A centralized manager that handles all haptic feedback with these methods:

- **`taskCompleted()`** - Light haptic when a task is marked as complete
- **`taskUncompleted()`** - Soft haptic when a task is unmarked as complete
- **`taskAdded()`** - Success haptic when a new task is created
- **`taskDeleted()`** - Medium haptic when a task is deleted
- **`buttonTap()`** - Light haptic for general button interactions
- **`selectionChange()`** - Subtle haptic for toggles and selections
- **`reminderReceived()`** - Success haptic when notifications are received
- **`taskOverdue()`** - Warning haptic for overdue task detection
- **`validationError()`** - Error haptic for form validation failures
- **`dragStart()`/`dragEnd()`** - Feedback for drag-and-drop operations

### 2. Integration Points

#### TaskManager.swift

- **Adding tasks**: Success haptic when `addTask()` is called
- **Completing tasks**: Light haptic for completion, soft haptic for uncompleting
- **Deleting tasks**: Medium haptic for deletion
- **Setting reminders**: Selection change haptic when reminder is scheduled
- **Overdue detection**: Warning haptic when overdue tasks are found
- **Notification handling**: Success haptic when reminders are received

#### TaskRowView.swift

- **Completion toggle**: Prepared haptic generators for better responsiveness
- **Edit button**: Light button tap haptic
- **Delete button**: Light button tap haptic

#### ContentView.swift

- **Add task button**: Button tap haptic
- **Theme selector**: Button tap haptic
- **Drag operations**: Start and end haptics for task reordering
- **Alert buttons**: Button tap haptic for cancel actions
- **Overdue check**: Automatic check when view appears

#### AddEditTaskView.swift

- **Save task**: Success haptic when task is saved successfully
- **Validation errors**: Error haptic when title is empty
- **Toggle switches**: Selection change haptic for due date and reminder toggles

## Key Features

### 1. Performance Optimized

- Uses `prepareForInteraction()` to prime haptic generators for better responsiveness
- Haptic feedback is dispatched on the main queue when needed

### 2. Contextual Feedback

- Different haptic intensities for different actions:
  - **Light**: Button taps, task completion
  - **Medium**: Task deletion, drag operations
  - **Soft**: Task uncompleting, drag cancellation
  - **Success**: Task creation, reminders
  - **Warning**: Overdue tasks
  - **Error**: Validation failures

### 3. User Experience Focus

- Feedback is subtle and refined, not overwhelming
- Matches the visual animations for cohesive UX
- Provides confirmation for important actions
- Enhances accessibility through tactile feedback

### 4. Notification Integration

- Custom `NotificationDelegate` provides haptic feedback for reminders
- Handles both foreground and background notification interactions

## Usage Notes

- All haptic feedback is handled through the singleton `HapticManager.shared`
- Feedback is automatically integrated into existing user interactions
- No additional user settings required - feedback works out of the box
- Gracefully handles devices that don't support haptic feedback

## Benefits

1. **Enhanced User Confidence**: Users receive immediate tactile confirmation of their actions
2. **Improved Accessibility**: Provides non-visual feedback for interactions
3. **Professional Feel**: Makes the app feel more polished and responsive
4. **Better Task Management**: Clear feedback when completing, adding, or managing tasks
5. **Subtle Guidance**: Helps users understand when actions are successful or need attention

The implementation follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines for haptic feedback, ensuring it feels natural and enhances rather than distracts from the user experience.

## üõ† Technical Implementation Details

### Memory Management Architecture
```swift
// Automatic memory pressure handling
MemoryManager.shared.memoryPressure // .normal, .warning, .critical

// Memory-aware views
.memoryAware {
    // Cleanup actions on memory warning
}
```

### Caching Strategy
```swift
// Intelligent cache sizing
private let maxCacheSize = PerformanceConfig.Cache.maxFilteredTasksCacheSize
private let cacheValidityDuration = PerformanceConfig.Cache.cacheValidityDuration

// Batch operations
scheduleBatchUpdate(for: taskId)
```

### UI Optimization
```swift
// Debounced search
.debounced(searchText, delay: 0.2, key: "search-debounce")

// Optimized animations
.animation(UIOptimizer.optimizedAnimation(), value: shouldUpdate)

// Optimized rendering
.optimizedRendering(shouldUpdate: isDragging || task.isCompleted)
```

# Enhanced Animation Implementation for Due Date and Reminder Sections

## Overview
Completely redesigned and optimized the animations for due date and reminder edit sections in the AddTaskView with performance-first approach and smooth, delightful user experience.

## Key Improvements

### 1. Advanced Spring Physics
- **Replaced basic transitions** with sophisticated spring animations using optimal response and damping values
- **Device-adaptive animations** that adjust based on device performance capabilities
- **Smooth content transitions** with asymmetric insertion/removal animations

### 2. Performance Optimizations

#### UIOptimizer Enhancements
- **formSectionAnimation()**: Optimized spring animation for section containers
- **datePickerAnimation()**: Specialized animation for date picker transitions
- **toggleAnimation()**: Micro-interaction animation for toggle switches
- **contentTransition()**: High-performance transition for content appearance/disappearance

#### PerformanceConfig Updates
- **Form-specific animation settings** with optimal response and damping values
- **Device performance detection** for adaptive animation quality
- **Accessibility support** with reduced motion detection

### 3. Visual Enhancements

#### Toggle Switch Improvements
- **Subtle scale effect** (1.05x) when activated for tactile feedback
- **Haptic feedback integration** with selection changed and light impact
- **Smooth state transitions** with optimized spring physics

#### Section Container Enhancements
- **Dynamic shadow effects** that intensify when sections are active
- **Accent border highlighting** when due date or reminder is enabled
- **Smooth shadow and border transitions** synchronized with content animations

#### Content Transitions
- **Scale + opacity + movement** combined transitions for natural feel
- **Anchor-based scaling** from top for logical visual flow
- **Asymmetric animations** with different timing for insertion vs removal

### 4. Animation Specifications

#### Spring Parameters
```swift
// Form Section Animation
response: 0.4, dampingFraction: 0.8, blendDuration: 0.1

// Date Picker Animation  
response: 0.35, dampingFraction: 0.9, blendDuration: 0.1

// Toggle Animation
response: 0.25, dampingFraction: 0.85, blendDuration: 0.05
```

#### Device Performance Adaptation
- **High Performance**: Full spring animations with optimal parameters
- **Medium Performance**: Slightly adjusted parameters for stability
- **Low Performance**: Fallback to easeInOut animations

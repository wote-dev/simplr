# Kawaii Theme Persistence Test

## Issue Fixed
The kawaii theme selection was not persisting when the app was closed and reopened. The theme would revert to light theme even though the user had selected kawaii.

## Root Cause
The issue was in the `ThemeManager.updateTheme()` method. When the app launched and loaded the saved kawaii theme, but the user didn't have premium access, it would:
1. Fall back to light theme (correct)
2. Reset the theme mode to light (incorrect - this prevented persistence)

## Solution Implemented

### 1. Preserve Theme Selection
- Modified `updateTheme()` to preserve the kawaii theme selection even when premium access is not available
- The theme mode stays as "kawaii" but displays light theme as fallback
- When premium access is gained, the kawaii theme is immediately applied

### 2. Improved Premium Manager Integration
- Added Combine observation to watch for premium status changes
- Theme automatically updates when premium status changes
- Fixed timing issues between ThemeManager and PremiumManager initialization

### 3. Enhanced Theme Refresh Logic
- Added `setupPremiumObservation()` to monitor premium status changes
- Theme refreshes automatically when premium access is granted
- Proper cleanup with deinitializer to prevent memory leaks

## Testing Steps

1. **Enable Premium Access** (for testing):
   - Premium access is temporarily enabled in PremiumManager.init()
   - This allows testing the kawaii theme functionality

2. **Test Theme Persistence**:
   - Launch the app
   - Go to Settings > Theme Selector
   - Select Kawaii theme
   - Close the app completely (swipe up and swipe away)
   - Reopen the app
   - Verify kawaii theme is still selected and active

3. **Test Without Premium Access**:
   - Comment out the premium access lines in PremiumManager.init()
   - Select kawaii theme (should show paywall)
   - Close and reopen app
   - Verify kawaii theme selection is preserved (but shows light theme)
   - Purchase kawaii theme
   - Verify theme immediately switches to kawaii

## Files Modified

1. **ThemeManager.swift**:
   - Added Combine import
   - Added premium observation with AnyCancellable
   - Modified updateTheme() to preserve kawaii selection
   - Added setupPremiumObservation() method
   - Added deinitializer for cleanup
   - Enhanced setPremiumManager() to refresh theme

2. **PremiumManager.swift**:
   - Temporarily enabled premium access for testing

## Expected Behavior

âœ… **With Premium Access**:
- Kawaii theme selection persists across app restarts
- Theme immediately applies when selected
- Theme stays active after app restart

âœ… **Without Premium Access**:
- Kawaii theme selection is preserved
- Light theme is shown as fallback
- When premium is purchased, kawaii theme immediately applies
- No loss of user's theme preference

## Verification

To verify the fix works:
1. Build and run the app in Xcode
2. Navigate to theme selector
3. Select kawaii theme
4. Force close the app
5. Reopen the app
6. Confirm kawaii theme is still selected and active

The theme persistence issue should now be resolved! ðŸŽ‰

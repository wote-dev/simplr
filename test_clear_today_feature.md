# Clear Today's Tasks Feature Test

## Implementation Summary

Successfully implemented a long press gesture on the 'Today' tab icon that brings up a context menu to clear all today's tasks.

## Key Components Added:

### 1. TaskManager.swift
- Added `clearTodayTasks()` function that:
  - Filters incomplete tasks due today, overdue tasks, and tasks without due dates
  - Cancels notifications for deleted tasks
  - Removes tasks from Spotlight index
  - Provides haptic feedback
  - Updates the UI through data binding

### 2. MainTabView.swift
- Added `showingClearTodayAlert` state variable
- Added conditional context menu to Today tab button using `.if` modifier
- Added confirmation dialog with destructive action
- Added View extension for conditional modifiers

## User Experience:
1. User long presses on the 'Today' tab icon
2. Context menu appears with "Clear All Tasks" option
3. Tapping the option shows a confirmation dialog
4. User confirms the action
5. All today's incomplete tasks are deleted with smooth animation
6. Haptic feedback provides tactile confirmation

## Safety Features:
- Confirmation dialog prevents accidental deletion
- Clear warning message explains what will be deleted
- Only affects incomplete tasks (completed tasks remain safe)
- Proper cleanup of notifications and Spotlight entries

## Technical Details:
- Uses SwiftUI's `contextMenu` modifier for long press detection
- Leverages existing `confirmationDialog` for user confirmation
- Integrates with existing haptic feedback system
- Maintains consistency with app's design patterns
- Follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines

The feature is now ready for testing and provides a quick way for users to clear their today's task list when needed.

# QuickList Gesture Fix Test

## Issue Fixed
The QuickList input field had incorrect touch handling where tapping to focus would trigger drag behavior instead of normal text input.

## Changes Made

### 1. AddEditTaskView.swift
- Modified the `simultaneousGesture` with `DragGesture` to:
  - Increase minimum distance from 0 to 10 pixels to prevent accidental triggering
  - Exclude QuickList focus management from the scroll gesture
  - Allow QuickListView to handle its own focus management independently

### 2. QuickListView.swift
- Added explicit tap gesture handling to both add and edit text field containers:
  - Added `.contentShape(Rectangle())` to ensure the entire container area is tappable
  - Added `.onTapGesture` to explicitly focus the text field when tapped
  - This ensures tapping anywhere in the text field area properly focuses the input

## Test Instructions

1. Open the Simplr app
2. Create a new task or edit an existing task
3. Scroll down to the "Quick List" section
4. Tap on the "Add your first quick list item" text field
5. Verify that:
   - The text field immediately gains focus
   - The keyboard appears
   - No drag behavior is triggered
   - Text input works normally
6. Add an item and try editing it by tapping the edit button
7. Verify the edit text field also responds properly to taps

## Expected Behavior
- Tapping the text field should immediately focus it and show the keyboard
- No drag gestures should interfere with text field interaction
- Scrolling the form should only dismiss focus for title/description fields, not QuickList fields
- QuickList maintains its own focus management for better user experience

## Technical Details
- The fix separates gesture handling responsibilities
- Parent view (AddEditTaskView) handles scroll-to-dismiss for main form fields
- Child view (QuickListView) handles its own text field focus management
- Minimum drag distance prevents accidental gesture triggering
- Explicit tap gestures ensure reliable text field activation

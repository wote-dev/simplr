# Completed Tasks Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the implementation of the completed tasks feature for the Simplr app, which ensures that completed tasks appear in the completed tab, remain there for 7 days before automatic deletion, and allows users to undo completion.

## Key Features Implemented

### 1. Completion Date Tracking
- **Added `completedAt` property** to the `Task` model to track when tasks are completed
- **Migration logic** in `TaskManager.loadTasks()` to handle existing completed tasks without completion dates
- **Automatic date setting** when tasks are marked as completed or uncompleted

### 2. Automatic Cleanup (7-Day Retention)
- **`shouldBeAutoDeleted` computed property** in `Task` model to identify tasks older than 7 days
- **`cleanupOldCompletedTasks()` method** in `TaskManager` to remove old completed tasks
- **`performMaintenanceTasks()` method** that runs cleanup and overdue task detection
- **Automatic cleanup triggers** when app becomes active and on app start

### 3. Improved Completed View
- **Enhanced sorting** by completion date instead of creation date
- **Proper grouping** by completion date (Today, Yesterday, weekdays, and specific dates)
- **Accurate statistics** showing today's, this week's, and total completed tasks
- **Environment object sharing** to ensure all views use the same TaskManager instance

### 4. Undo Functionality
- **Preserved existing undo capability** in the completed view
- **Completion date clearing** when tasks are uncompleted
- **Notification re-scheduling** for uncompleted tasks with reminders

## Technical Implementation Details

### Task Model Changes
```swift
struct Task: Identifiable, Codable {
    // ... existing properties ...
    var completedAt: Date?  // NEW: Tracks completion timestamp
    
    // NEW: Computed property for auto-deletion logic
    var shouldBeAutoDeleted: Bool {
        guard isCompleted, let completedAt = completedAt else { return false }
        let calendar = Calendar.current
        let sevenDaysAgo = calendar.date(byAdding: .day, value: -7, to: Date()) ?? Date()
        return completedAt < sevenDaysAgo
    }
}
```

### TaskManager Enhancements
```swift
class TaskManager: ObservableObject {
    // Enhanced completion toggling with date tracking
    func toggleTaskCompletion(_ task: Task) {
        // Sets completedAt when completing, clears it when uncompleting
    }
    
    // Automatic cleanup functionality
    func cleanupOldCompletedTasks() {
        // Removes tasks older than 7 days
    }
    
    func performMaintenanceTasks() {
        // Runs cleanup and overdue detection
    }
    
    // Migration logic for existing data
    private func loadTasks() {
        // Handles existing completed tasks without completion dates
    }
}
```

### App-Level Integration
```swift
@main
struct SimplrApp: App {
    @StateObject private var taskManager = TaskManager()  // Shared instance
    
    var body: some Scene {
        WindowGroup {
            // ... views ...
            .onReceive(NotificationCenter.default.publisher(for: UIApplication.didBecomeActiveNotification)) { _ in
                taskManager.performMaintenanceTasks()  // Auto-cleanup trigger
            }
            .onAppear {
                taskManager.performMaintenanceTasks()  // Initial cleanup
            }
            .environmentObject(taskManager)  // Shared across all views
        }
    }
}
```

## Testing
Comprehensive unit tests have been added to verify:
- **Completion date tracking** when tasks are completed/uncompleted
- **Auto-deletion logic** for tasks older than 7 days
- **Proper retention** of recent completed tasks
- **Edge cases** like tasks without completion dates

## User Experience Benefits

1. **Reliable Completed View**: Completed tasks now consistently appear in the completed tab
2. **Automatic Cleanup**: No manual maintenance required - old tasks are automatically removed after 7 days
3. **Undo Capability**: Users can easily undo task completion from the completed view
4. **Proper Chronological Organization**: Tasks are grouped by actual completion date
5. **Accurate Statistics**: Real-time stats for today, this week, and total completions
6. **Data Migration**: Existing users' completed tasks are properly handled during app updates

## Maintenance & Performance

- **Efficient Cleanup**: Only runs when app becomes active, not continuously
- **Memory Efficient**: Old tasks are removed from memory and storage
- **Data Integrity**: Migration ensures no data loss for existing users
- **Minimal Impact**: Cleanup operation is fast and runs in background

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements could include:
- Configurable retention period (7 days is currently hardcoded)
- Export functionality for completed tasks before deletion
- Advanced filtering options in completed view
- Completion statistics and insights

## Files Modified

1. **`Simplr/Task.swift`** - Added `completedAt` property and auto-deletion logic
2. **`Simplr/TaskManager.swift`** - Enhanced completion handling and added cleanup functionality
3. **`Simplr/SimplrApp.swift`** - Added shared TaskManager and automatic cleanup triggers
4. **`Simplr/CompletedView.swift`** - Improved sorting, grouping, and statistics
5. **`Simplr/TodayView.swift`** - Updated to use environment TaskManager
6. **`Simplr/UpcomingView.swift`** - Updated to use environment TaskManager
7. **`Simplr/ContentView.swift`** - Updated to use environment TaskManager
8. **`SimplrTests/SimplrTests.swift`** - Added comprehensive tests for new functionality

This implementation ensures a robust, user-friendly completed tasks system that automatically maintains itself while providing full undo capabilities.

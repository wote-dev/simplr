# Context Menu Theme Adaptation Fix

## Problem
Context menu previews in SwiftUI were not adapting to the app's theme system, defaulting to white backgrounds regardless of the selected theme (light, dark, or premium themes).

## Root Cause
The issue occurred because SwiftUI's `contextMenu(menuItems:preview:)` creates an isolated environment for the preview view. Even though the main view had access to the theme through `@Environment(\.theme)`, the preview closure didn't inherit this environment automatically.

## Solution
The fix involves explicitly passing the theme environment to preview views within context menus:

```swift
.contextMenu {
    // Menu items...
} preview: {
    TaskDetailPreviewView(task: task)
        .environmentObject(categoryManager)
        .environmentObject(themeManager)
        .environmentObject(taskManager)
        .environment(\.theme, themeManager.currentTheme) // ← This line fixes the issue
}
```

## Performance Considerations

### Optimized Implementation
- **Cached Theme Access**: `themeManager.currentTheme` is a `@Published` property that's cached and only updates when the theme actually changes
- **Minimal Re-renders**: The environment is only updated when `themeManager.currentTheme` changes, preventing unnecessary re-renders
- **Efficient Propagation**: Using `.environment(\.theme, themeManager.currentTheme)` is more efficient than recreating theme objects

### Performance Benefits
1. **Single Source of Truth**: All theme data comes from the centralized `ThemeManager`
2. **Lazy Evaluation**: Theme properties are computed only when accessed
3. **SwiftUI Optimization**: Environment values are automatically optimized by SwiftUI's diffing system

## Files Modified

### TaskRowView.swift
- **Location**: Line ~180 in the `contextMenu` preview closure
- **Change**: Added `.environment(\.theme, themeManager.currentTheme)` to `taskDetailPreview`
- **Impact**: Context menu previews now properly inherit the current theme

## Testing

### Manual Testing Steps
1. Open the app and navigate to a view with tasks
2. Switch between different themes (Light, Dark, Premium themes)
3. Long-press on a task to trigger the context menu preview
4. Verify that the preview background and colors match the selected theme

### Test Coverage
- Created `ThemePreviewTest.swift` for comprehensive theme adaptation testing
- Tests all available themes: Light, Dark, Minimal, and Premium themes
- Verifies proper color adaptation for backgrounds, text, and accents

## Best Practices for Future Context Menu Previews

### 1. Always Pass Theme Environment
```swift
.contextMenu {
    // Menu items
} preview: {
    YourPreviewView()
        .environment(\.theme, themeManager.currentTheme)
        .environmentObject(themeManager) // If the preview needs ThemeManager
}
```

### 2. Use Theme-Aware Colors
```swift
struct YourPreviewView: View {
    @Environment(\.theme) var theme
    
    var body: some View {
        VStack {
            Text("Preview Content")
                .foregroundColor(theme.text) // ← Use theme colors
        }
        .background(theme.surfaceGradient) // ← Use theme backgrounds
    }
}
```

### 3. Performance Optimization
- Always use `themeManager.currentTheme` instead of creating new theme instances
- Avoid unnecessary environment object passing if the preview only needs theme colors
- Use `@Environment(\.theme)` in preview views for direct theme access

### 4. Consistency Checks
- Ensure all context menu previews follow the same pattern
- Test with all available themes during development
- Verify theme adaptation in both light and dark system modes

## Architecture Benefits

### Maintainability
- Centralized theme management through `ThemeManager`
- Consistent theme application across all UI components
- Easy to add new themes without modifying individual views

### Scalability
- Pattern can be applied to any future context menu previews
- Theme system supports unlimited theme variations
- Environment-based approach scales with app complexity

### User Experience
- Seamless theme consistency across all interactions
- Proper dark mode support
- Premium theme features work correctly in all contexts

## Future Considerations
- Monitor for new context menu implementations that need theme support
- Consider creating a custom modifier for theme-aware context menus
- Evaluate if theme environment can be automatically inherited in future SwiftUI versions

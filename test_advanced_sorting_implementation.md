# Advanced Sorting Implementation Test

## Changes Made to TodayView.swift

### 1. Added SortOption Enum
- **Priority**: Default sorting with urgent tasks first, then overdue, then by due date
- **Due Date**: Sort by due date (earliest first), undated tasks at bottom
- **Creation Date**: Sort by creation date (newest first)
- **Alphabetical**: Sort alphabetically by task title

### 2. Updated State Management
- Added `@State private var selectedSortOption: SortOption = .priority`
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing filter functionality

### 3. Enhanced Sorting Logic
Replaced hardcoded priority-based sorting with dynamic sorting based on `selectedSortOption`:

```swift
switch selectedSortOption {
case .priority:
    // Original priority-based logic (urgent first, overdue, due date, creation date)
case .dueDate:
    // Sort by due date, then creation date for undated tasks
case .creationDate:
    // Sort by creation date (newest first)
case .alphabetical:
    // Sort alphabetically by title using localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare
}
```

### 4. Updated UI Menu
Replaced simple filter menu with comprehensive sort and filter menu:
- **Sort By Section**: Shows all sort options with icons and checkmarks
- **Filter Section**: Maintains existing filter functionality (All, Pending, Overdue)
- **Visual Indicators**: Checkmarks show current selections
- **Icons**: Each sort option has a descriptive icon

### 5. Menu Button Icon
Changed from filter icon (`line.3.horizontal.decrease.circle`) to sort icon (`arrow.up.arrow.down.circle`) to better represent the combined functionality.

## Expected Behavior

1. **Default State**: Priority sorting (maintains existing behavior)
2. **Sort Options**:
   - Priority: Urgent → Overdue → Due Date → Creation Date
   - Due Date: Earliest due date first, undated tasks by creation date
   - Creation Date: Newest tasks first
   - Alphabetical: A-Z by task title
3. **Filter Integration**: All sort options work with existing filters (All, Pending, Overdue)
4. **Animations**: Smooth transitions when changing sort/filter options
5. **Haptic Feedback**: Button tap feedback maintained

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Menu opens and shows both Sort By and Filter sections
- [ ] Sort options display correct icons and titles
- [ ] Checkmarks appear next to selected options
- [ ] Priority sorting maintains original behavior
- [ ] Due Date sorting orders tasks by due date
- [ ] Creation Date sorting shows newest tasks first
- [ ] Alphabetical sorting orders tasks A-Z
- [ ] Filters work with all sort options
- [ ] Animations are smooth
- [ ] Haptic feedback works
- [ ] Menu button shows sort icon

## Implementation Notes

- Maintains full backward compatibility
- Uses SwiftUI best practices with proper state management
- Leverages existing animation and haptic systems
- Follows iOS Human Interface Guidelines for menu design
- Efficient sorting with single-pass algorithm
